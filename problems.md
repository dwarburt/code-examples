Problem 1:
 Write a function that takes an array which may contain integers as well as nested arrays of integers, and returns the total sum of all integers, regardless of the nesting depth.
Example:
 Input: [1, 2, [3, 4], [[5]], 6]
 Expected Output: 21
Problem 2:
 Write a function that returns the first non-repeating character in a string. If all characters repeat, return an appropriate value (such as None).
Example:
 Input: "swiss"
 Expected Output: "w"
Problem 3:
 Write a function that, given a string, finds the length of the longest substring without any repeating characters.
Example:
 Input: "abcabcbb"
 Expected Output: 3 (the substring "abc")


Problem 4: 
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true
